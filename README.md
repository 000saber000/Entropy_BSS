# Random Binary Sequence Entropy Calculator

This Python script generates random binary sequences with varying probabilities of occurrence for the digit '1'. It then calculates the entropy of each sequence.

## Introduction:

Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a system. In the context of binary sequences, entropy quantifies the unpredictability of the sequence. This script allows you to explore how the entropy of a binary sequence changes with different probabilities of observing the digit '1'.

## Features:

- Generates random binary sequences with specified probabilities of occurrence for the digit '1'.
- Calculates the entropy of each generated sequence.
- Supports customization of the number of sequences and probability ranges.

## Usage:

1. **Requirements:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script uses the NumPy library.
2. **Installation:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. **Navigate to Directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. **Run the Script:** Execute the script using Python.

   ```bash
   python entropy_calculator.py
